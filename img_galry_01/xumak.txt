image dimensions used in this component:

624 x 450 main image
137 x 105 album thumbnails
85 x 66 thumbnails (shown as 64 x 48 in tablet and desktop but using same image)

the height of the main image is flexible though.
it HTML, CSS would also work with a image that has 624 width and 350 height.
so the width is fixed, the ratio can be changed. (just remember to put correct
height and width attributes into the <img /> element)

- - - 

there is a hidden span which carries a JSON object of all the albums and images
used in the component. this JSON object should be written in there on first page load,
so no AJAX calls are needed to load different albums, images, etc.

- - -

the loading animation shows whenever an image is being sent to the browser and disappears
when the image is loaded/cached.
